shakesbot

this was a pedagogical exercise for learning ruby (though I liked the idea and
would've done it in python at some point anyway).

It's a robot that parses HTML files downloaded from http://shakespeare.mit.edu/
and "performs" them on twitter. See http://twitter.com/shakesbot to see how it
works.

as it's not really useful outside of my one shakespeare robot I'm just leaving
it as is; but it could be adapted into a general 'twitter player' for other
kinds of structured performances in XML or HTML. Until then it will just remain
as source code (ie not a gem or anything).

usage

./shakesbot.rb [--loop] [--interval SECONDS] play1.html play2.html...
